== 3. Files in this release ==
*	ITAG3.0_CDS.fasta
	fasta-format sequence file of CDS sequences.

*	ITAG3.0_REPET_repeats_agressive.gff
	GFF version 3 file containing repetitive regions. This contains repeats identified by REPET
	pipeline and contains comprehensive repeat annotation.

*	ITAG3.0_RepeatModeler_repeats_light.gff
	GFF version 3 file containing repetitive regions. ITAG3.0 protein-coding gene models were
	identified after masking genome with this file. This contains repeats identified by RepeatMasker
	using RepeatModeler generated custom repeat library. Known proteins were identified in the repeat
	library to improve chances of protein-coding gene identification.

*	ITAG3.0_cDNA.fasta
	fasta-format sequence file of cDNA sequences.

*	ITAG3.0_gene_models.gff
	GFF version 3 file containing gene models in this release. 

*	ITAG3.0_proteins.fasta
	fasta-format sequence file of protein sequences.

*	ITAG3.0_proteins_full_desc.fasta
	fasta-format sequence file of protein sequences with full description.

* 	ITAG3.0_proteins_interproscan.tsv
	Interproscan results generated with interproscan-5.22-61. Please see https://github.com/ebi-pf-team/interproscan/wiki/OutputFormats for column descriptions
